# Posts Directory

This directory contains your blog posts in MDX format.

## Structure

- Place your `.md` or `.mdx` files in this directory
- Each file should have frontmatter metadata (title, date, tags, etc.)
- The blog system will automatically process these files

## Content Privacy

This directory is excluded from the GitHub repository to protect your content privacy. All posts remain local on your machine.

## Adding Posts

1. Create a new `.md` or `.mdx` file in this directory
2. Add proper frontmatter metadata
3. Write your content in markdown
4. Run the data generation script to update the blog metadata
